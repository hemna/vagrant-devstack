Test whether the configuration stuff is working correctly on 'polishing' branch
- Integrate fc passthrough into Vagrantfile
- Make config.yaml optional, so that it works correctly without one.  Requires having a fixed box name/URL
- Write up wiki page on how to get started
- Figure out how to make it work with remote horizon. Maybe use bridged networking?
